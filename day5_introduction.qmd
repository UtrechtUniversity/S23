In these exercises we focus on analyzing intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling (also referred to as ecological momentary assessments).

We will use data from @bringmann_network_2013, stored in file `Bringmann1.dat`. It contains data from 129 persons, with each between 20 to 60 repeated measurements per variable. Throughout these exercises we will focus on two variables: Somber (to what degree are you feeling somber right now?), and Event (report on the most important event since the previous beep and indicate how unpleasant-pleasant is was).
