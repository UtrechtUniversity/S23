In their model, the autoregressive relationships are modeled between the observed variables. This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter is invariant over time and lies between-1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters.},

              This study examined the transactional interplay among dimensions of destructive interparental conflict (i.e., hostility and dysphoria), children's emotional insecurity, and their psychological problems from middle childhood and adolescence. Participants were 232 families, with the first of five measurement occasions occurring when children were in first grade (
              M
              age = 7 years). Cross-lagged, autoregressive models were conducted with a multiple-method, multiple-informant measurement approach to identify developmental cascades of interparental and child cascades. Results indicated that emotional insecurity was a particularly powerful mediator of prospective associations between interparental conflict (i.e., dysphoria and hostility) and child adjustment during adolescence rather than childhood. In reflecting bidirectionality in relationships between interparental and child functioning, children's psychological problems predicted increases in interparental dysphoria during childhood and adolescence. Although emotional insecurity was not identified as a proximal predictor of interparental difficulties, an indirect cascade was identified whereby insecurity in early adolescence was associated with increases in teen psychological problems, which in turn predicted greater interparental dysphoria over time. Results are interpreted in the context of how they advance transactional formulation of emotional security theory and its resulting translational implications for clinical initiatives.},
